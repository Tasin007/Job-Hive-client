Features for the Job Seeking Website:
1.Dynamic Website Name: Just like before, the website name should be dynamic to reflect the nature of the job-seeking website.

2.User Registration and Login with Firebase: Update the user registration and login functionality to allow job seekers to create accounts and log in securely.

3.Job Listings Page: Replace the "All services" page with a "Job Listings" page that displays all available job positions. Implement a search functionality to allow users to search for specific job titles, locations, or companies.

4.Job Details Page: Create a page where users can view detailed information about a particular job posting. Users who are logged in can apply for the job by submitting their resume and additional information.

5.Add Job Listing Page: Implement a feature that allows companies or recruiters to add job listings to the website. They should be able to provide all the necessary details about the job, such as job title, description, requirements, and application instructions.

6.Manage Job Listings Page: Companies or recruiters should have a dedicated page where they can manage the job listings they have posted. They should be able to edit, delete, or mark positions as filled.

7.User Schedule Page: Create a page where job seekers can manage their application schedules. They should be able to view the status of their applications and any upcoming interviews or assessments.

8.404 Page: Keep the 404 page in case users enter a wrong route on the website.

9.User Session Management: Ensure that the website handles user sessions appropriately, preventing users from being redirected to the login page when reloading the page. Update the AuthState accordingly.
